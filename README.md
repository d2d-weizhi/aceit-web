# AceIt: A Student Assignment Tracker

AceIt is a visually-driven student assignment tracker web application built with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, designed to help students stay organized, manage deadlines effectively, and gain insights into their academic performance. It is also part of a series of portfolio showcase projects that I'm currently managing.

## Why AceIt?

At the time of writing this, I am still a part-time student myself, I knew firsthand the challenges of juggling coursework, deadlines, and a life outside of academics.  Going back to my time as a full-time student, I still remember how easy it can be to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of assignments, especially when juggling multiple courses or modules. 

I've chosen to build AceIt as a way to address a personal need for a more visually driven, intuitive assignment tracker.  I wanted a tool that would fulfil a few core functionalities:

- üëÄ Provide a clear overview of upcoming deadlines and progress. No more scrambling to remember due dates or feeling lost in a sea of tasks.

- üçï Help me break down large assignments into manageable tasks. Conquering a project, one step at a time.

- üìä Offer insights into my study habits and performance. Understanding my strengths and areas for improvement.

AceIt is crafted with simplicity and effectiveness in mind. It leverages the power of data visualization to empower students to take control of their academic journey and, as the name suggests, **AceIt**!

## Daily Logs (Latest to Oldest)

### 4th May, Sun: Home View UI Prototyping

- **TODO:** When I have the time, I should do some digging to see if we can scroll the view to the current date.
- **TODO:** I also want to figure out how to customize the dates in Week View mode to just `"dd/MM"`, and remove the short day of the week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc). 

- Added the `ExpansionPanel`. It is no longer called Accordion.
- By default, I will display top 3 on-going assignments with upcoming deadlines.
- I've also added a sample Gantt Chart view into the content areas.
- Added some sample data into `sample-aceit-data.ts`.

### 3rd May, Sat: Continue with UI Prototyping

- _**TODO: Figure out how to make the SideDrawer slide in from underneath the menu button instead of over it.**_
- _**TODO: Finish adding in the on-going assignments and reminders to the Dashboard Page.**_
- _**TODO: Need to add another row so we can display the tabs to toggle between "Home" and "Stats".**_
- Remembered that the Dashboard page should also have two column layout.
- Decided to create a simple Tab Bar component called `AceItTabBar` instead of using KendoReact's TabStrip component.
- Added theRadar/Spider chart to the Stats View section.
- Reminder: Important to know when to use Margins versus Paddings.
- Added some placeholder UI files (one-time use components).

### 2nd May, Fri: Started UI Prototyping

- Start by implementing the 2-column layout for both Assignments & Tasks pages.
- Added CSS animations for the transitions when user interacts with the left panels.
- Left Panel will slide to the left. And Right Panel will transition from an opacity value of 0 to 1.
- When closing the Right Panel, the Left Panel will wait until Right Panel is fully hidden from view before sliding back to the middle.
- Used a single grid layout for Dashboard Page.
- The SideDrawer's Close button has been added to the overlay.
- Increased the font size of the menu items.
- Added some more padding.
- Enlarged the width of the menu for more spacing.
- For the Stats Widgets, I have managed to align the contents the way I want it.
- Stats figures will be in `<div></div>` instead of `<span></span>` to make it easier to align them.
- The Stats titles are shifted to the top of the widget.

### 1st May, Thu: Completed the UX Wireframes

- Created the sketched wireframes for our app.
- Realized that there might be a challenge when it comes to page navigation when viewing the app in mobile (portrait) mode. Will need to consider this solution later.

### 29th Apr, Tue: Scope Breakdown & UX Wireframes

#### Goal for Today

- Break down the high-level scope into detailed functionalities and features for each page of the app that we're showcasing.
- Keep the scope to within 3~5 pages. There can be smaller pop-ups like KendoReact Windows/Dialogs within those pages, and it's fine. Within the context of this project, we're referring to actual web pages/navigation.
- Generate a series of hand-drawn wireframes for the different pages and key sections.

#### What was Done
- Generated the Next.js boilerplate project.
- Updated the README file.
- Finished the work breakdown. There could be other pages/features we can include later.

#### What I've (Re)Learned/Discovered
-

#### Potential Challenges/Solutions
-

### 28th Apr, Mon: Opening Project Discussion

- Worked with Gemini to brainstorm and decide on the next showcase project.
- Decided to name it "AceIt".
- This will be a school assignment tracking app.
- Defined the scope (high-level), and core features.
