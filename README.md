# AceIt: A Student Assignment Tracker

AceIt is a visually-driven student assignment tracker web application built with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, designed to help students stay organized, manage deadlines effectively, and gain insights into their academic performance. It is also part of a series of portfolio showcase projects that I'm currently managing.

## Why AceIt?

At the time of writing this, I am still a part-time student myself, I knew firsthand the challenges of juggling coursework, deadlines, and a life outside of academics.  Going back to my time as a full-time student, I still remember how easy it can be to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of assignments, especially when juggling multiple courses or modules. 

I've chosen to build AceIt as a way to address a personal need for a more visually driven, intuitive assignment tracker.  I wanted a tool that would fulfil a few core functionalities:

- üëÄ Provide a clear overview of upcoming deadlines and progress. No more scrambling to remember due dates or feeling lost in a sea of tasks.

- üçï Help me break down large assignments into manageable tasks. Conquering a project, one step at a time.

- üìä Offer insights into my study habits and performance. Understanding my strengths and areas for improvement.

AceIt is crafted with simplicity and effectiveness in mind. It leverages the power of data visualization to empower students to take control of their academic journey and, as the name suggests, **AceIt**!

### 29th Apr, Tue: Scope Breakdown & UX Wireframes

#### Goal for Today

- Break down the high-level scope into detailed functionalities and features for each page of the app that we're showcasing.
- Keep the scope to within 3~5 pages. There can be smaller pop-ups like KendoReact Windows/Dialogs within those pages, and it's fine. Within the context of this project, we're referring to actual web pages/navigation.
- Generate a series of hand-drawn wireframes for the different pages and key sections.

#### What was Done
- Generated the Next.js boilerplate project.
- Updated the README file.
-
